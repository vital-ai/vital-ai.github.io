					VitalSigns provides development tools to define a data model across the 
					entire application and generate objects, which are then used in various 
					components, including the Application's User Interface, Vital Flows, and 
					Hadoop.	
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					This means that the definition of the "User" object is the same in the 
					Application's User Interface, in Vital Flows for recommendations, and in 
					the Hadoop machine learning jobs.  This speeds development and eliminates 
					many problems with data incompatibilities.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					VitalSigns handles data mapping across components, across different 
					programming languages and data repositories.
