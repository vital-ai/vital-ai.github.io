					The Vital Client is added to your application, providing an API to 
					access the Vital Platform.  The Vital Client includes a cache of data 
					objects to improve performance, the REST and Queue interfaces, and the 
					VitalSigns data mapping component, which aligns your application data 
					model with the Vital AI Platform.  VitalSigns greatly improves 
					development efficiency, eases integration, and eliminates additional 
					data mapping and other data maintenance.

				<div class="why-title">
					The Vital AI platform includes Machine Learning, Natural Language 
					Processing, Logical Inference, Graph Analytics, Data Analysis via 
					Hadoop, Web Crawling, integration with Twitter and Facebook, and large 
					scale semantic data management, available via the Vital Client.
