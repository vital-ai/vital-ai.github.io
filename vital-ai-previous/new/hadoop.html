				<div class="why-title">
					The Vital Platform uses Hadoop for large-scale data processing, including 
					machine learning analysis.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Data stored in HBase is available for analysis using Map/Reduce jobs, as 
					is data from application events (such as log data), typically written to HDFS.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					A Vital Flow, initiated via DataScript, may trigger a Map/Reduce job.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					The output of a machine learning job is a learned model.  The model is 
					loaded into a Vital Flow step which can be used in Vital Flows in 
					categorization.
