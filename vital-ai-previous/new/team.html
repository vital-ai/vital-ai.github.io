				<div class="why-title">
					Marc Hadfield loves to create software that understands data.  He has 
					been a CTO of several start-ups over the past ten years before founding 
					Vital.AI, most recently Inform Technologies.  Inform applied Natural 
					Language Processing to the Enterprise Publishing space.  Prior to Inform, 
					Marc was CTO of Alitora Systems, which used large scale data analysis to 
					gain insight into disease processes for drug discovery, primarily using 
					Natural Language Processing to understand research articles.  In creating 
					many data driven applications, Marc gained experience building out the 
					necessary infrastructure -- this has led to creating the Vital Platform 
					to do the heavy lifting in creating data driven applications, leaving 
					time to focus on the cool algorithms such as Natural Language Processing 
					to understand text or Graph Analysis to find the interesting parts of 
					graphs, and then use this insight to add value to applications.

					Derek has worked closely with Marc at both Inform and Alitora, 
					implementing both back-end large scale semantic applications and 
					front-end web and mobile user interfaces.  Derek can integrate anything 
					with anything, and probably already has.  Derek is an expert at the 
					details of the Java Platform and Semantic Web technologies and standards.
