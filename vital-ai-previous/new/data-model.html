					Data Model
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Vital AI provides a low-level Core data model which allows different 
					data processing components to have a common data framework.
				</div>
				<img id="why-image-3" src="images/vitaldatamodel_med.png"/>
				<div class="why-title">
					This Core data model is extended to include objects for common use cases, 
					such as "User", "Document", "Event", and others.	
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					This Vital Domain Model is extended to include objects that are required 
					for an application.  This becomes the Application Domain Model.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					For example, if an application will recommend movies to users, then the 
					application may extend the domain model to include objects for "Film", 
					"Actor", and "Genre".
