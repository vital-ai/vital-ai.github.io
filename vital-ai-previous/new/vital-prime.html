				<div class="why-title">
					The Vital Platform uses Vital Prime servers in the implementation.  
					Vital Prime provides in-memory data storage and analysis, interfaces to 
					data repositories, and access to data processing using Vital Flows or 
					Hadoop.  Additionally, Vital Prime implements authentication / 
					authorization for application users.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Vital Prime is accessed via a REST interface.  Event objects, such as 
					user "clicks", can be sent to Vital Prime via the Queue interface.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Event data sent via queue is typically sent into the Data Matrix, which 
					counts events by type and group.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Vital Prime processes queries using a connected data repository such as 
					a text index, a triplestore (NoSQL) database, or HBase.
				</div>
				<div class="why-title">
					Vital Prime provides a scripting interface.  Such scripts are called 
					"DataScripts".  DataScripts implement application data processing 
					functionality including defining data processing workflows ("Vital Flows"), 
					processing real-time data analytics in the Data Matrix, or accessing the 
					cache and connected data repositories.  DataScripts can be run 
					periodically using the JobEngine.  DataScripts can be called via the 
					application using the callFunction REST API call.  Application 
					functionality is typically implemented via a DataScript, including 
					common features such as returning "top content", "recommended content", 
					or "trending content".
