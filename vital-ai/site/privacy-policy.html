<font size="3">Vital AI is committed to protecting user privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) that we collect from users of our website (<a href="http://www.vital.ai" target="_blank">http://www.vital.ai</a>), our products (the "Products") and related services (the "Services"). By submitting Personal Data through our website, Products or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    
<br><br><b>The Privacy of Personal Data</b><br>

All data and information that users upload or import into Vital AI is protected and available only to us and users who specify and approve of, per the Terms of Service or, if applicable, our license agreement. The Privacy Policy below is meant to address the protection of any Personal Data that we collect from users in keeping with applicable laws and regulations.

We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data as described below.

The use of your Proprietary Data is expressly governed and protected by the Terms of Service or, if applicable, our license agreement.

<br><br><b>Personal Data Collected from Users</b><br>

We may collect Personal Data from users, such as first and last name, e-mail address, company name, address, professional title and area of professional focus via our website, Products and Services. If you are a user of our Products or Services and create an account to login to our network, we will also collect a password and retain information on the users behalf, such as Vital AI searches, files and other data, to facilitate your use of the Products and Services.

<br><br>If you provide us feedback via e-mail or contact us regarding any matter, such as an employment opportunity posted on our website, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content or information that you submit to us and include in the e-mail, such as a resume, in order to send you a reply.

<br><br>We also collect other types of Personal Data provided to us voluntarily, such as a users operating system and version, Product registration number, and other requested information if a user contacts us via e-mail regarding support for the Products or Services. In addition, we may also collect Personal Data from a user via the Products or Services, or at other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.

Like most internet-based services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access an account on our network.

<br><br><b>Personal Data Collected from Users About Others</b>

<br>If a user decide to create an account for and invite a third party to join our network, we will collect the users and the third party's names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. The user or the third party may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@vital.ai">info@vital.ai</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.

<br><br><b>Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</b>

<br>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Policy, only Vital AI collects Personal Data through our website, Products or Services provided solely by Vital AI. Our partners may supply us with Personal Data, such as your address information, in order to help us establish the account. This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use our website, Products or Services.

<br><br>Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as payment processing websites, is for user convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When a user clicks on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after clicking on a link to a third party.

<br><br>We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as a user's name) that make the data personally identifiable that user. We use this Anonymous Data to perform statistical analyses of users' aggregate behavior so that we may enhance the content of our Products and services and improve site navigation. Vital AI reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion.

<br><br>In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect our services and users, or to ensure the integrity and operation of Vital AI's business and systems and our services, Vital AI may access and disclose any information and content Vital AI considers necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, information about users (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic information, usage history, and submissions.

<br><br><b>Disclosure of Personal Data</b>

<br>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. However, we may share users' Personal Data with third parties to conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of accounts, provide technical support, or provide specific services, such as synchronization of user contacts with other software applications, in accordance with your instructions. These third parties are required not to use Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Vital AI and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements with regard to their use of such information. Users expressly consent to the sharing of Personal Data with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to the user.

<br><br>If the user opts-in to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our Products or Services and may contain advertisements for third parties. Should the user decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from those third parties.

<br><br>Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Vital AI may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Vital AI; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Vital AI or users of the Products and Services.

<br><br>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.

<br><br><b>Control of Personal Data</b>

Vital AI has implemented industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Data. We store Personal Data behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers, and implement technology to detect intrusions.

In addition, Vital AI protects your Personal Data from unauthorized physical access by storing Personal Data in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Vital AI limits access to Personal Data in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Vital AI's organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we conduct regular internal audits and vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with these security measures and generate security incident logs that track data useful in screening for attempted abuse of or unauthorized access to Personal Data.

<br><br>Even though Vital AI has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Vital AI cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
