Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as payment processing websites, is for user convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When a user clicks on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. However, we may share users' Personal Data with third parties to conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of accounts, provide technical support, or provide specific services, such as synchronization of user contacts with other software applications, in accordance with your instructions. These third parties are required not to use Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Vital AI and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements with regard to their use of such information. Users expressly consent to the sharing of Personal Data with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to the user.

If the user opts-in to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our Products or Services and may contain advertisements for third parties.
